• Do what is necessary (post scripts, make configuration changes to the tool, use features of the
tool, etc) to allow us to meet the following requirements with the output from the tool.
• Ignore issues that we no longer want to see (because we’ve investigated or simply don’t
care about that particular issue) in future runs of the tool.
• No or limited manual steps should be involved in each run of the tool.
• Combine the data from the scanning tool with other data to form a more complete view of what
devices are on our networks. The ideal situation would be to have every IP address on each
VLAN with information as indicated below.
• IP address (NOC)
• MAC address (NOC)
• Date the IP was last seen on the network (NOC)
• Is it in DNS? (DNS lookup or some other way?)
• Is it in DHCP? (InfoBlox)
• If a windows machine, patches waiting to be installed in WSUS? (our server)
• Domain (AD and/or Ninite)
• OS version (WSUS and/or Ninite)
• OS build (Ninite)
• Ninite related updates (Ninite)
• Local IP (Ninite)
